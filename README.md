# vivo-pdf-bruteforce
This useless program try to guess the password of a given PDF file encrypted by Vivo (vivo.com.br). Made for learning purposes.

PDF's are encrypted by [Vivo](https://www.vivo.com.br) using a **3 numeric characters length** password, so the strategy is to iterate from 001 to 999 until find the password.
